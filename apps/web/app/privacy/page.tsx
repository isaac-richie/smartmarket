                <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Wallet addresses</span>: Public EVM addresses you
                connect to the Platform. These are public on-chain identifiers and are shared with Polymarket, Ondo Finance, and PancakeSwap for routing and compliance.

          <Section title="5. Geoblock Checks">
            <p>
              When you access the Platform, we proxy a geoblock check to Polymarket by forwarding your IP address.
              This is required to comply with Polymarket&apos;s regional restrictions. Your IP is forwarded to
              Polymarket but is not stored by Rawli Analytics.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="6. Cookies and Local Storage">
            <p>
              The Platform uses browser localStorage to cache the following data locally on your device:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1.5 list-disc list-inside">

          <Section title="7. Data Retention">
            <p>
              Wallet-linked data (trading profiles, reward events, referrals) is retained for the lifetime of your
              account or until you request deletion. Analysis generation records are retained to operate caching,
              rewards, and product reliability. When report fees are enabled, payment verification hashes are retained
              to prevent replay attacks.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="8. Your Rights">
            <p>You have the right to:</p>

              <li>Request deletion of your profile data</li>
              <li>Request a copy of data associated with your wallet address</li>
              <li>Disconnect your wallet at any time</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Since we do not collect email addresses, deletion requests must be submitted via the Platform interface or
              by contacting us with a signed message from your wallet.
