          <Section title="2. Description of Service">
            <p>
              Rawli Analytics is a non-custodial trading interface that routes prediction market orders through
              Polymarket&apos;s Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) protocol. The Platform does not custody funds, hold
              user assets, or act as a counterparty to any trade.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              All trades are executed on-chain via Polymarket&apos;s smart contracts. Rawli Analytics provides the
              interface and routing infrastructure only.

          </Section>

          <Section title="3. Eligibility and Restricted Regions">
            <p>
              You may only use the Platform if you are not located in, and are not a citizen or resident of, any
              jurisdiction where prediction market trading is prohibited or restricted by applicable law. This includes,

              PancakeSwap on BNB Chain. These tokens represent real US equities and are classified as securities under
              applicable law.

          <Section title="7. Risks: Prediction Markets">
            <p>Prediction market trading involves substantial risk. You may lose all funds you trade. Specifically:</p>
            <ul className="mt-3 space-y-1.5 list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Prediction market outcomes are binary, and you may lose 100% of your position.</li>
              <li>On-chain transactions are irreversible.</li>
              <li>Smart contract bugs, oracle failures, or liquidity issues may result in loss of funds.</li>
              <li>Market prices reflect crowd sentiment, not guaranteed outcomes.</li>
              <li>Events may resolve unexpectedly or be contested, resulting in delayed or disputed payouts.</li>
              <li>AI-generated analysis provided by the Platform is not financial advice and may be inaccurate.</li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section title="8. Risks: Tokenized Stocks">
            <p>Tokenized stock trading involves risks distinct from prediction markets:</p>
            <ul className="mt-3 space-y-1.5 list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Stock prices can move continuously, and you may experience unlimited losses if the company fails or the stock price falls to zero.</li>
              <li>Smart contract bugs in Ondo Finance or PancakeSwap may result in loss of funds or inability to withdraw.</li>
              <li>BNB Chain validator risks, network outages, or blockchain reorganization may prevent or delay transactions.</li>
              <li>rToken token redemption may be subject to conditions or delays set by Ondo Finance.</li>
              <li>You do not hold actual shares. You hold tokenized exposure only, which may differ in treatment from traditional stock ownership.</li>
              <li>Regulatory changes affecting tokenized securities may impact your ability to trade or the value of your holdings.</li>
              <li>Market liquidity for rTokens on PancakeSwap may be limited, resulting in wider spreads and slippage.</li>
            </ul>
          </Section>

          <Section title="9. Fees">
            <p>
              The Platform charges a platform fee on trades (currently 0.5%, subject to change). Premium intelligence
              reports are free during the current testing phase. If pricing returns later, all fees will be disclosed
              prior to any transaction.
            </p>
